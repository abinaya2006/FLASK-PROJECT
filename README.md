# FLASK-PROJECT
Goal of the Project:
In class 124, you created a Flask app where you can make a POST request to an API to add a task to a task-list.

In this project, you will create a Flask App where you can make a similar POST request to add the contacts to a contact-list .

Story:
Research shows that use of ‘smartphones’ reduces the cognitive ability of an individual to focus on a task. After studying the research, you have decided to give up on smartphones and go back to using landline phones.

One of the primary difficulties you anticipate having is storing contacts. You have decided to write an API using which you can store contacts by sending POST requests.
